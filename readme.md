# Weather cloud API üì°

**‚ö†Ô∏è work in progress**

## What is it?

weathercloud.net is a web application that logs and makes weather data from personal weather stations publicly accessible.

**-> This is a reverse engineering of the private API used to retrieve data from one station.**

npm run dev
```

### Build app

```bash
npm run build
```

OR

```bash
npm run clean
```

## Currently Supported

 - ‚úîÔ∏è Device info
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Last update info
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Actual weather data
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Computation of various data based on received values including:
   - Clouds height

   - [RETURN] Object (type weather_data)
 - Get last update info
   - [URl] `app.weathercloud.net/device/ajaxupdatedate`
   - [DATA] `d={id}`
   - [RETURN] Object (type last_update)
 - Get owner and station profile data
   - [URl] `app.weathercloud.net/device/ajaxprofile`
